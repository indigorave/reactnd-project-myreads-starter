## Description
This MyReads app is part of the Grow with Google FrontEnd Nano degree program.  The app allows the user to sort a library of books into three categories: I am Currently Reading, I Want to Read, I have Read.  The user able to move books from one category or "shelf" to another by selecting a new category from the dropdown.  On the search page, accessible by clicking the magnifying glass at the bottom of the home page, the user is able to search the library for all books regardless of category. Using the same drop down functionality that exists on the homepage, the user is able to assign a different category to the book.

## Notes
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_Terms.md. That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
